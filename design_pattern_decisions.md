From the 'Smart Contracts' section, I learned to use **inheritance** design pattern when writing my smart contracts.  

I applied this technique in the `WorldSwapToken` contract, inheriting ERC721URIStorage, to allow me to include a URL which will return metadata for the ERC721 tokens generated by the contract.  This will allow me to include unique characteristics for each token in the future.  I also inheritited from ERC721Enumerable to be able to iterate over the tokens, which allowed me to display only the tokens for a specific user/address in my UI.

In the `MetaMarket` contract, I inherited from IERC721Reciever interface and implemented the `onERC721Received` method, allowing the contract to receive ERC721 tokens, a crucial part of the functionality for this project.  

Another design pattern I learned is the **ownable** design pattern.  I wrote a modifier in the `MetaMarket` contract named `onlyOwner()` which will be used to ensure that the transaction fees collected on a sale (not yet implemented) can only be withdrawn from the contract by the contract owner.  The modifier and owner functionality is ready for when that feature is implemented.
