## Metaverse NFT Marketplace

The goal for this project is to create an NFT marketplace designed to buy and sell goods strictly from metaverse games and projects.  

Initally focused on ETH based assets.

Initial goal:
 - allow users to connect their ETH wallet (metamask)
 - allow users to list an NFT from an approved list of metaverse projects
 - allow users to buy listed NFTs via smart contract

 Next steps:
 - pull available assets from across the metaverse to list
 - offer a fiat bridge to allow purchase via credit card
 - allow users to add their assets to a DAO, which will act as rental pool
   - gamers will be able to lease the assets from the DAO for a fee, revenue shared back to participants of the DAO
